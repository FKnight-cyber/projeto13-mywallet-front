## Projeto 13 MyWallet

On this project i had to create an e-wallet type of application using React for front-end, Node.js for back-end and using MongoDB Atlas as database.

### libs
I've used joi and string-strip-html for validation and sanitization of the data processed by the back-end and uuid plus bcrypt for encrypting.
In the front-end i've used axios, dayjs, framer-motion, react-icons, react-loader-spinner, react-toastify ,styled-components, sweetalert.
